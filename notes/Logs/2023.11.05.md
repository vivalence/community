# thoughts
## on photos resolvers
so for the first flashcards resolver i built this elaborate structure of FlashcardsGameSetupObject's and their children. type resolvers. 
i dont think this approach makes sense for game resolvers. my guess is that approach is better suited for the app/interface resovlers because the types they opperate on are more structured and also reused. for the games its such a one off and specific resover type. ill try the loop resovlers without such a fancy structure and then decide on the pattern

ok another thought. since i do have input objects, i can make input objects for specific type resolvers.
then my query and mutation resolvers are just passing input arguments to their dedicated resolver functions....
then my game setup & loop objects would need to contain each a gamestate resolver or such.
i have two Flashcards InputTypes:     UnitUpdateInput    and  GameStateInput.
they elicit each one response object: UnitUpdateResponse and  GameStateResponse
 
then in my mutations i have
in flashcardsInit i call with GameStateInput and get GameStateResponse
in flashcardsLoop i call with GameStateInput and UnitUpdateInput and get  GameStateResponse and UnitUpdateResponse.

problem here is naming. because actually what i have is 
FlashcardsGamePlayStateInput
FlashcardsGamePlayStateResponse
and 
FlashcardsGameUnitRelationInput
FlashcardsGameUnitRelationResponse

ok first off i am making this hard on myself. this is not short term condusive.



this is overloading my brain.
not sure how happy i am with the architecture of the type resolvers. feels arbitrary. 
but ok its now done
