ok so i should start maintaining a list of games i want to have in the app for language learning.
active recall as in say 5 sentences about some topic that was practiced recently.
and another would be something like either translate this text sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, or in its entirety.
then of course the write whole texts but ok.

so i am oszillating on wether i want vivalence to move as fast as possible to AI or to stay at language and figure that out.
so i think i can figure something out thats vastly more effective. i have doubts if i can make it addictive and thus used.
and i also question if there is not maybe too much competition in the market. 
i can get the 1000 true fans paying 10 down to maybe 200 if each pays 50 or 50 if each pays 200. but thats still a mouthfull to accomplish. if there is a public component to the company as its looking like with the podcast and all ill probably be able to sell first seats at 200 if i do it via patreon / similar. and then i can do perks like custom made shirts, ceramics, etc. ok i like this idea a lot. do it open source and build a fan base. then i have to split the fanbases between podcast and app? hmm i have to  think about that.
one fear i have is if i want to open source the core abstraction already because if it is actually correct and as genious as i think it is it will be stolen. maybe i only opensource the thing once we build the platform. but 1. then i cant do patreon or similar strategy. and i cant tell such a good story. hmmm.

i dont yet know what the best strategy for the next six months is.
but i know i must find it.
ok so karl starts by working out the RPG game. then probably some other game or mechanic or optimization inside the language space.
i need him to take a look sooner or later, rather sooner, on the fastai course and start defining the corpus for that space. and not by proxy through llms or whatever methods. start with hand crafting types and relations and properties. then we can abstract it.

where do i want to be in 6 months? thats april.
i want to have a killer language learning app. 
i want to not have chosen wrong about opensourcing.
i want to have tried onboarding users and payed. 
i want to have launched the podcast and be 2 or 3 seasons in with 10.000 active listeners.
how do i get 10.000 active listeners by april.
lets say i start with the first episode on the 10th december. then an episode per week. thats 20 episodes by end of april.

how much do i need for the first seasons. not that much. 
chapter 0 about intro and philosophy is the first episode. i dont want to go nuts here
then chapter 1 about archaic from pre writing to greek should be 3 episodes at most. sum 4
chapter 2 greece i can spend some time and should. there is the whole sparta vs athenian thing, the pedophilia, the standards that were established, different schools and their reactions cumulating in the academia, citicenship and education, education for war, sports and music, then comes alexander and his fervor. settlement of mediteranian sea. i am thinking 6-8 episodes. sum 10-12.
chapter 3 rome is interesting for legal, military, statesmanship, economics, statecrafting and creating unity among people and calming savages, culutural amalgamations. also all the ground laying for the middle ages and renaissance. 6-8 episodes. sum 16-20. 
chapter 4 islamic golden age. uff no clue but 4 episodes is a good guess so that brings me above my 20.

so until april i am talking everything up to and probably excluding because i need breaks and so forth, the islamic age. intro, pre, greek, roman. good set. thats april.

how do i get 10.000 people to listen regularly. by having 100.000 try it. how do i get 100.000 to try a new podcast?
fuck. who could be amplifier? spotify maybe but they are too big for me to matter to them. joining some podcast unio? giving up control and forcing ads, hmmmm. podcast appearences. sure. shoutouts and stuff. Twitter? reels and tiktok.? 
who is my audience?
educators and history afficionados. 
all the girls who want to fix the world too.

hmm probably manual labor, word of mouth, shoutouts and some luck.



ok so goals are 

  * [ ] 10.000 listens to my +- 20th episode on +- 28th of april 
  * [ ] spanish learning app with complete corpus, 25 curricula (5 with narrative), 10 different games, 4 different game types, (maybe 100 users)
  * [ ] meaningfull (tbd) progress on the ai course
  * [ ] incorporation of the company.



# aside on criticallity
i dont like this emphasis on criticallity for its own sake. the core value should be the impetus to improve ones world and criticallity is a requirement for this. but currently it is taught and herolded and practices as an end in itself which is destructive and ugly.


# blooms taxonomy
## knowledge
recite the definition of peome
## Comprehesion
describe what a poem is in their own words
## application
teach what a peom is to someone
## analysis
break a peom down into their constituent parts
## synthesis 
write your own peom
## evaluation
judge if a peom is bad or not


ok i got some issues with this when it comes to ordering and hierarchy. but i guess the order in which they are achieved doesnt have to reflect the hierarchy in which they are layed out.

ok so another question is if i take classes at 9.30 each day and have to leave house at 9.10 thusly, how do i create my mornings.
i must have the veggies prepped if i want them. then steak and veggies are possible

but i also need 30 minutes for sports. 
15 meditation and 
5-15 for vocal training (i work with timers here. 30/30s lips)
cooking and eating takes up, call it 45 with cleaning.

90 minutes + hygene.
so 2 hours up before i have to leave.
i leave at 9.10 so up at 7.

7 up. go clean.
7.30 showered and stuff. go breakfast.
8.15 eaten and cleaned. go to sports 
8.45 sports done. meditate 15 minutes. vocal 15 min. 
9 get ready leave the house. 

that means lights out 1030. washed and drugged.
