so i did a major brainstorm on a bunch of shit up the road. its all in the black book.
i went from  'lets build the whole corpus logic in supabase now' to 'ok ill just build it into the current schema' to 'fuck this shit, way too difficult. i do the absolute minimum now'.
here is the minimum:
i create curricula for sets of vocabulario for A (a1 a2).
and for grammar for maybe 15 verbs in 5 tenses.
thats it.

i am also kinda half adding user now. which i hate. but it makes sense to keep the first version of vivalence as a web app, it makes sense to allow access to users and each have their own learning experience and state.
so, begrudingly i must admit that it makes sense to build the app for many users now.
anyfuckingways.
maybe ill make some moneymountains.
but besides having one user in the db, i wount do anything.

so whats next.
I create curricula. specific instances in the database.
this will require me to
1. fill up the conjugation, verbstem, verbending datasets.
2. create units from conjugation and vocabulario

ill keep my cards open towards the question if i want to create curricula for verbstem, verbending.
