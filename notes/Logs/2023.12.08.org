* migration pos to unit
so i created the ontology tags enum which holds all the various types and tags a unit can inherit from its ontology.
now i must figure out how ill set that up on the unit.
there are two types of units. one words one conjugation. they require different information.
conjugation contains all that info on tense asf. i must create a mapping of what enums i have on ontology side and which on unit side.

i start there.
wait
maybe it makes more sense to not make them enums but objects.
i can make objects learnable. i can change their names. i can do all kinds of things on objects i cant do on enums. hmmm. lets say i do that on the application level. do i also do it on the ontology level?
so many decisions.
no ill start with that on just the application side.
do i create a unittag relation?
if a tag is learnable.
no it then needs a taguserrelation.
word.
this whole xyrelation thing is either the most genius or the dumbest shit ever. time will tell.
ok then i must first create the tags.
ok tags created. what now
now i must itterate over the conjugations and create the tag unit relations by name
conjugations are running.
now the words. 
in words i have to map each key in the partofspeechenum to the tags. so one property.
actually i just must map the enum onto the the same name.
but i forgot to add the Verb conjugation tag to  

ok alldone. tags created and connected to units. now what.
back to the sentence generation.
and then pipe it to the frontend.

ok so how do i 
build the prompt now?
from curriculum, filter on tags.
i start on the curriculum and include units matching x? 
i can find units by tags.
ok
thats nice
now
i must define the sets of tags i want to filter on
ie that i want to prompt with
and then i must define a number of those units
then what.
prompt.

i have a function for filtering by tags for new units and one for playing units.

but i am still now really compfy. kind of unsure how to prompt.
i guess no way but through. ill just do the unsure thing.

making tags into objects made some devx tasks very shit

for some reason i dont have adjectives done correctly.
i did. i jsut didnt include any adjectives in the curriculum.
this gets to one of the hurdles of this approach.
i am going to have to include all the tags in the curriculum that go into a sentence and i must include a lot of specificity in the sentence prompt to create good sentences.
its in that sense not really very good at isolating.
hmm.
one way to solve would be to make curricula recursive. a curriculum can contain other curricula.
leads to circularity.
hmm
it should be able to contain tags.
maybe a curricula can contain functions and be build from them.
hmm such a clusterfuck.
well i need more units in the curriculum rn so ill just spam some shit in there.

i need
grammar ie
performer
tense
conjugations

i want
pronouns
nouns
adverbs
adjectives 

shit its 2. i must do that tomorrow.
ok tomorrow i add these to the curriculum. then i continue prompting. fuck i am never getting to it.
this is too complicated for my little brain.
