## Project Timelines
We are thinking about timetables and what things to be done when. Motivation is to figure out when @Karl can join Full Time, which will require financial resources. 
Those can be provided through Revenue Streams from course works or through investment. We agree that we want to force the issue by January'24. 
I want to have four things in place by then.
### 1. 
A Spanish language course to demonstrate the application layer.
### 2. 
Ingestion of Fastai resources for corpus building 
### 3. 
UI demonstration of the various games of the AI course
### 4. 
Pitchdeck to highlight the mission, vision, roadmap, opportunities etc.
