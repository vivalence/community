## open
i should start keeping track of my network
like phonecalls and shit.
but that i can only track if i encypt some notes.
that shouldnt be a problem.
i can use some emacs encrypter.el on the md files.
there was my call with the education consultant from berlin.
we talked about our backgrounds and motivations, then his swiss project. i said that i am looking for a commercial cofounder. (i should define that role better). 

## podcast
what do i do here?
read more books.
take notes.
step 1 and 2 lol
step three is to setup a figma ... board?
miro board?
probably miro is better for this. 
i should setup a miro board. ok what do i want from this?

i want a vertical timeline. i should think about splitting that by what time resolution? it should either be logarithmi, linnear, or a time scale centered on events / chapters of my story.
ill sketch out the time scales of the chapters. and if that fits neatly into some logarithm or other pattern ill do that.
then horizontal i do the pace layers. pretty simple. probably ill run into issues with events not fitting neatly into a layer and events being spread out accorss layers. what do i do then? color coding? boards? shit no idea. ill just install miro and set that up.
what do i need to play around here?
i need the chapters and some example events per chapter. then i can draw the timelines and check for pacelayer conflict.
its not events its narratives. when i do my 
season > chapter > episode
what are my chapters and whats the narrative?

pre history
greek
roman
asian / chinese / afrikan / american / arabic
middle ages / church
renaissance
reformation
...

## gpt
i should design the mother of all prompts, and throw the book in. either chapter by chapter or book by book.
id want to know the main terms that were defined and covered. the people involved.
the institutions built and their shapes.
sources of funding, training and economic status of teachers, 
who had access and who didn't.
daily life of the students or teachers or administrators of these institutions.
the main ideas and requirements shaping the inception and development of the institutions / education.
then i want a summary of the narrative broken into pace layers.
a detailed outline of the chapter and episode.
criticism. whats false, outdated, incomplete? perspectives to add.
summarize the narrative per chapter in 10-20 sentences. 
event timeline. major milestones
when did subjects emerge first?
subjects taught in school, at what age, 
what methods were used to teach?
who are the people how's works echoed through the epochs? and what were their works. 




before i do this i should check how much of the pdf fits into one context window and how much that costs.
then i should unblock the pdf. maybe i can just use the epub tho. i need to check if i can programatically read epub.
is 3.5 fine or do i need 4?
price? 

i should probably sketch out at least a chapter or a episode to check for blindspots.

how can i aide gpt i identifying or crystalizing the right narrative?
i dont know yet what the narrative of each chapter should be.
maybe i should do some sort of convolution here. sets of 3 chapters. summarize the middle one. something like it. 
or maybe i do multiple passes. one high level, which provides input and context to the other passes.




## timing
i want to start when?
i need to read at least parts of the oxford book.


# how do i do it
this is so much work. 
like in total.
what else i got to do? licence. 
theory and practice.
theory is when i am back in asturias maybe 1-3 days and then i HOPEFULLY graduate that.
practice i can do a few hours a day. i ll do the first lesson and then see if i want to BLOCK or DRIP it.
then i got a lot of travel coming up.
and spanish practice but thats a DRIP thing and just part of my routine. where? not after sport. 
i need a ipad stand and keyboard. and also use it as a second screen. nice for dev work.
ill setup a schedule here.

### 9 days once i am in asturias

probably flashcards for different node types, which shouldnt be anything more than a mask.
and if @karl delivers the rpg, implement that too.

### then 10 days of travel, hamburg, madrid.
i should set specific activities of hamburg and madrid. 
not development. i can do reading, design, and communication.
