# thoughs on tutorials.
ok so there is a thing ghosting through my skull. it came about because i read an absolute horsehit garbage article/guide/tutorial on how to integrate tailwind, storybook and svelte. the issue with the article was that it explained a bunch of very specific steps 'do x, then do y' while completely sidestepping any reason or articulation.
this is actually a major frustration and a razon d'etre for viva. ive run into this so many times when i started programming and all the time actually. so the problem with this is twofold aitrn. first is that its fragile. somethign changes in the chain or the env is slightly varied in the wrong way and all the effort goes to shit and frustration and confusion ensue. 2 is that its not actually helpful even if it works on any scale larger than the specific problem i am facing rn. no conceptual step is made. no insight into why is gained. the reader still has to make the abstraction through itteration and stuff.
it should be the other way around. the article should start with something like "this is how it works and thats why we need to combine X and Y in way Z. since our desired outcome is A, we could also do B and C. now to do A you do ....". so stating the moving parts and their relation first. and then describing how to sow them together, always starting from parts > composition > desired state > actions to achieve state. this way a user gains 1. a largely supperior understanding and 2. can assess the issues arising in terms of specific state divergence. this also means that any explanation needs to contain tools for state assessment.


# today
setup the background requirements for developing a sophisticated design system. 
all the colors are equal in figma and tailwind.
we have a storybook setup. 
started to develop the button component. 
## tomorrow
