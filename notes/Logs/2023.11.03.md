# thoughts
## text and buttons
Text and Button arent at 100% but enough to work with.
any non functioning states can be integrated into the framework in place.
i dont think ill be thoroughly surprised by anything from these components. 
maybe here and there a question of how to pass colors or interactive states on text. whatever

## container
is container also a grid?
i mean i need to decide how ill handle rows and columns and shit.
is that a function of the container component?
probably not.
so i need to provide 2 components here. or three rather
container, grid and cell.
or container row and columns or whatever.
hmm ill lunch and then fix.

## arend call
so what do i want to know?
i want to know  what legal form to use.
i have a .org which should contain the os code and be able to receive donations and employ.
i have a .com which is responsible for commercial, should be fundable, and donate profits and funding to the .org.


and about good locations to fund.
portugal, germany, estonia.

CRITERIA: funding & support, legal effort, talent, 

# pitch
there are multiple different moving parts to be explained and they are interrelated.

i usually start with the problem space or scale of problem.
universities are wasteful by doubliction of work accross location and time. and non collaboratively itterative as their courses dont compound and aggregate their improvement from students and year after year.
same with online platforms. their courses are once done, dont improve. 


1. courses shouldnt be done, they should learn and improve with usage. 
- the person who has just grokked a skill might have some insight into possible improvement of the teaching of this specific skill.
2. learning should be about skills and problem solving not knowledge. we dont need scientists we need builders and creators.
3. dependencies between skills can be mapped. resulting in a interconnected tree of competence, or corpus. 
- example: you need % before you can calculate interest, and you need * before you can do % and + before *.
4. this allows for self directed learning. a learner can pick a node the corpus and because all the dependencies are mapped the software can create a custom curriculum.
5. instruction should be done digitally, tutoring and mentoring in person.


so we will create wikipedia for competence along with a organization to sell it as a service.

the .org will provide 2 'products'. 
1. the software that the users, mentors and teachers will use to do and build learning experiences
2. the data that constitutes the corpus. 

the .com will provide 2 services. 
1. it will install and maintain the software for a client
2. it will translate their skills into the corpus.
