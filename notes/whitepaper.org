a golden circle (what why how)

roadmap for product business and company

vision/mission texts

elevator pitch

an explanation of what i think the company architecture will be like.
money flows, costs, stuff like that

tech architecture
what systems and components will there be.
what processes need there be to host the systems on premise.
how will the .com public offering be done.

** Vision
so i think a good way to formulate the vision is to take a few startups and write out why we are different.
another method is to take a 3 timescales and write out what we want to achieve in each of them.
another method is to articulate the value we provide to students, teachers, universities, states, culture.
another method is to describe the moving parts of the organisation. what roles are there, what sort of people.


** Elevator Pitch
i need a quick clean story that i can tell that explains the problem, how our solution works, why our solution is different and better. and how we will make money and how they can help.


** Low-Resolution Roadmap
* what is VIVAlence
** waste
i usually start with the problem space or scale of problem.
universities are wasteful by doubliction of work accross location and time. and non collaboratively itterative as their courses dont compound and aggregate their improvement from students and year after year.
same with online platforms. their courses are once done, dont improve. 

** orientation

Your key frustRation arises from tutorials or guides that prescribe a series of steps to achieve a particular outcome without explaining the underlying reasons or concepts. These types of guides are fragile and unhelpful because they do not allow for adaptation to different environments or contexts. They also fail to provide insights, limiting one's ability to comprehend the bigger picture and understand why certain steps are necessary. 

To address this issue, you intend to design explanations that first provide conceptual understanding and then proceed with specific actions. This approach begins by outlining the individual components and their relationships, the desired outcome, and finally the steps to attain that outcome. By doing so, users gain a superior understanding, can diagnose issue in terms of specific state divergences, and gain tools for assessing the state of their work.

** principles

1. courses shouldnt be done, they should learn and improve with usage. 
- the person who has just grokked a skill might have some insight into possible improvement of the teaching of this specific skill.
2. learning should be about skills and problem solving not knowledge. we dont need scientists we need builders and creators.
3. dependencies between skills can be mapped. resulting in a interconnected tree of competence, or corpus. 
- example: you need % before you can calculate interest, and you need * before you can do % and + before *.
4. this allows for self directed learning. a learner can pick a node the corpus and because all the dependencies are mapped the software can create a custom curriculum.
5. instruction should be done digitally, tutoring and mentoring in person.

great teachers are rare and transformative.
the person who has just learned something has somehting valuable to offer to the next person who is learning it.
the person with deep knowledge of a subject is not necessarily a good teacher.
teacher is essentially a social job. it is about being a guide, orianter, motivator, and a source of feedback.

skill aquisition is hierarchical and traceable.
even complex skills are made of components that can be learned intentionally.



** wikipedia for competence

so we will create wikipedia for competence along with a organization to sell it as a service.

the graph is a corpus of skills and their dependencies.

skill graph is the corpus and shared in the public domain.  collaboratively created.
then we have the software that uses the corpus to create learning experiences. 
then we have the organization that sells the software and the service of creating the corpus for organizations.

** the solution
*** three layers
**** corpus
**** application
**** social

i want to provide a graph that a user can click on any node and the software creates a course for him.
the system can test the learners proficiency in any skill.
the system can provide the learner with materials and games needed to grok a skill.
the system learns about the learner and the set of all learners and can improve thus the learning experience.


lifelong learning companion plattform.
global digital education system.

** social layer
on top of the corpus, and  the learners experience, there can be built a social layer. where people can find either instructors for specific topics, mentor that guide them, or peers that they can collaborate with. for each of those they can see the parts of the corpus they have injested. they can see the skills they have.
people can endose each others skills. people can assess and certify each other.


then you have a social network of learners, mentors, and instructors.
you can also attach that to a cv, 

** what
the .org will provide 2 'products'. 
1. the software that the users, mentors and teachers will use to do and build learning experiences
2. the data that constitutes the corpus. 

the .com will provide 2 services. 
1. it will install and maintain the software for a client

.com service: 2. it will translate an organizations skills into the corpus.

** Notes Summarized
*** Summary
- Aiming to the education system into the information age. designing it as if we were starting from scratch using a first principles approach. focus on skills over knowledge, being learner-centric, utilizing technology, building for bottom-up and solving the cold-start problem by providing the value as a service to companies and hijacking existing infrastructure.
- The system is designed to augment the static nature of current educational models by providing an adaptive, skills-oriented learning environment that improves with user engagement. Hijacking existing infrastructure.

*** Key Issues with Current Systems
- Repetitive efforts of teachers across educational institutions without cumulative improvement. 
- Lack of individualization and personalization in learning experiences. Learners dont have choice.
- Instructional materials that fail to foster robust learning due to a lack of foundational concept explanation. students asking "Why am i learning this".
- The learner can't provide feedback or input. Material is once-done. 
- education is too focused on testing information assimilation. but we need creators and builders who can solve problems, not recite facts.

*** "Wikipedia for Competence" Concept
- Collaborative Skill Graph: A publicly developed and shared database of skills known as the corpus.
- Individualized Learning Experiences: Utilizing the corpus to customize educational trajectories.
- Social Interaction Layer: A communal platform enabling connections between learners, mentors, and instructors.

*** Core Principles
- Crowd Sourced: no central authority can or should supply all the materials. there needs to be a marketplace to supply and regulate.
- Evolving Coursework: Learning materials must adapt and refine based on contributions from learners and teachers.
- Skill Acquisition: The emphasis is on developing problem-solving skills, not just knowledge retention. and a builders mindset.
- Skill Dependency Mapping: A structured "corpus" allows for the creation of personalized learning pathways.
- Self-Directed Learning: Learners must be allowed to follow their interest and curiosity.
- Integrated Learning Approach: Merges digital content delivery with personal mentorship and tutoring.

*** The Solution - Structured into Three Layers
   1. Corpus: A living, expansive database of skill relationships.
   2. Application: The software framework that leverages the corpus for educational development.
   3. Social Component: A network designed for collaborative learning, mentorship, and skill validation.

*** The Solution
product and company

*** Roadmap
**** Pre Funding Goals
